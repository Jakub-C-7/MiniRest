## Testing

The project was developed using the Test Driven Development methodology, and includes unit and integration tests. 

```bash
# Run the tests
mvn test
```

The API has been tested using the RestAssured library. 

Mockito has been used where appropriate to mock dependencies and isolate units of code.

## CSV Parser

The application parses a CSV file located at `src/main/resources/data.csv` and saves its contents to the database. 

The application handles cases where there are one, multiple, or no records in the CSV file, and when the file is of an invalid format.

This is initiated at application start-up using a `CommandLineRunner`.
